# UnixOperation Github Programming Lessons
###### Wanting to learn pygame, but don't know where to start
###### Don't worry we have your back. lets start lets begin with the basics

# Some Extras
#### We have uploaded some examples of pygame programs that have been created for anyone to test out and take to edit. Under folder `Examples`

# Learining to Pygame!
#### All Related files can be found Under folder `Tutorial`

Create a python file lets name it `game.py` open it up with any python editor.
Now lets add some code to test for pygame, first. Write `import pygame` then for the nextline write `pygame.init()`


It Should look something like this
 1. | import pygame
 2. | pygame.init()

If it returns the error `No module named 'pygame'`, you will need to install pygame with pip (`pip install pygame`)

Now remove all the code, lets program the basics for pygame

###### The code is written in the file named `pygame_file_01.py`

the code what is written in the file creates a display named screen with the dimensions 500x500. it then creates a loop what will only end if the [x] is pressed in the corner of the display, then at last the pygame display updates
